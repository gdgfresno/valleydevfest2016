# 2016 Valley DevFest

The repository is transferred to a new organization because we'll fork multiple repositories from GDG-x Hoverboard (like the WTM 2017 conference). There can be only one fork of a specific repository per organization. A solution could have been to break the fork relationship, but I didn't want to loose the history of my work.

The transferred repo: https://github.com/ValleyDevFest2016/valleydevfest
